Current issues:

- If pipe or redir is inside quotes, I dont ignore the pipe and redir!!

- Strange behaviour of Bash:
    lsx              command not found           code 127
    /bin/lsx         no such file                code 127        right code but wrong message ???
    cat infilexx     no such file                code 1





- If first cmd includes slash: (xxx/xxx), it will give error: No such file
    lsxxx       "command not found"
    /bin/lsxxx  "no such file"
    So, with slash, it needs to extract the last word before the slash /


- If just pressed tab twice, it prints content from ls ???


- issue with command ls option -la:  ls: cannot access ''$'\260\b''x*8V': Invalid or incomplete multibyte or wide character

- Leaks in Valgrind: coming from run_cmd -> ms_execve
                                        -> get_env_array
                                        -> ft_find_env_passnum -> ft_strncmp

If you try in main() blocking the line: g_status = run_cmd(&info, cmd_list), then leaks are gone


- Echo:  escape character, ie:   "  \"    "
    In bash it prints just   "  

- exit: it will probably need some return value to the ms_execve, so it must know, 
    that it has to exit the whole program, not just the child process.

- case: wc | ls    or     cat | ls
    does not give ls, just waits.
    then try ctrl-d, it gives error: wc: stdin: read: input/output error

- No error when command is wrong, ie: catxxx
    Also, no error when wrong option, ie:  cat -xxx
