Current issues:

- No error when command is wrong, ie: catxxx
    Also, no error when wrong option, ie:  cat -xxx

- Built-in is executed twice: one mine and one original.
    Needs some kind of a flag to avoid skip the original

- Each call of 'cd' is causing that ctrl-d needs to be called more times to really exit.
    This comes from run_cmd(). Apparently when builtin is called, then run_cmd() must not execute 
    the same command again.

LATEST CHANGES - pushed 13 may:

- In the testmain_jaka.c:
    I fixed the endless loop in my check_syntax.c, so now the condition
        if (src.inputline[0] == '\0')
    can be removed in main().



- I made a version of Makefile, with small changes: now all the object-files go to the folder 'obj_dir'
    The copy is called Makefile_jaka.



- Something about the 'echo':
    Echo needs to recognize the option -n
    But if option -n comes in quotes, it must be ignored and just print -n 
    So maybe, when you remove the quotes during expansion, there can be 
    some kind of a Flag, or something.



- In the struct t_cmd:
    I added 1 new variable 'exit_code', to be able to return 258 in case of 
    syntax error.
