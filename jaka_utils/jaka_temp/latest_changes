Current issues:

- !!! Handeling double quotes ""in all three syntax check, is now messing checking double pipes inside "aaa | | bbb"
    LOOK INSIDE redirect_utils

- In case < ls  ,message twice: infile not exist + no such file ...
        Then it exists minishell

- single . or double dot ..  does not report 'command not found'
    should be:   .   filename argument required     exit code 2
                ..   command not found              exit code 127

- echo tilda, should display home path
- echo "a"  now working, now the other issue is back:   "aaa"b  KO
                                                        aaa"b"  ok

- syntax error with pipes, exits, instead of going back to minishell

- checking between quotes, for double || or  > >  =>> probably also needs to check between single quotes





- If pipe or redir is inside quotes, I dont ignore the pipe and redir!!

- Strange behaviour of Bash:
    lsx              command not found           code 127
    /bin/lsx         no such file                code 127        right code but wrong message ???
    cat infilexx     no such file                code 1

- If first cmd includes slash: (xxx/xxx), it will give error: No such file
    lsxxx       "command not found"
    /bin/lsxxx  "no such file"
    So, with slash, it needs to extract the last word before the slash /


- If just pressed tab twice, it prints content from ls ???








- Echo:  escape character, ie:   "  \"    "
    In bash it prints just   "  

- exit: it will probably need some return value to the ms_execve, so it must know, 
    that it has to exit the whole program, not just the child process.

- case: wc | ls    or     cat | ls
    does not give ls, just waits.
    then try ctrl-d, it gives error: wc: stdin: read: input/output error

- No error when command is wrong, ie: catxxx
    Also, no error when wrong option, ie:  cat -xxx

LATEST CHANGES - pushed 13 may:


- In the testmain_jaka.c:
    I fixed the endless loop in my check_syntax.c, so now the condition
        if (src.inputline[0] == '\0')
    can be removed in main().



- I made a version of Makefile, with small changes: now all the object-files go to the folder 'obj_dir'
    The copy is called Makefile_jaka.



- Something about the 'echo':
    Echo needs to recognize the option -n
    But if option -n comes in quotes, it must be ignored and just print -n 
    So maybe, when you remove the quotes during expansion, there can be 
    some kind of a Flag, or something.



- In the struct t_cmd:
    I added 1 new variable 'exit_code', to be able to return 258 in case of 
    syntax error.
